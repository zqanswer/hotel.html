				<p class="p0">Towns. One Amazing Experience.</p>
				<p class="p1">  <br/>
It is a place of legend, nestled at the end of a lush canyon and surrounded by some of<br/>
Colorado’s most rugged peaks. Nowhere else in the country, or perhaps the world, does<br/>
such a place exist.  To some, we are known for incredible alpine skiing. To others, summers <br/>
full of cultural events and endless outdoor activities.  By everyone, we are embraced for our <br/>
authentic mountain character, unpretentious attitude, and celebration of four seasons of<br/>
adventure in the most beautiful spot of the Rocky Mountain high country. <br/></p>

					<div class="main2-left-bottom">Telluride is tucked into a box canyon surrounded by 13,000 and 14,000-foot peaks. The town of 
					Telluride is just eight blocks wide and twelve blocks long. Because  its significant role in the history of
					the American West, the core area of Telluride was designated a National Historic Landmark District inz
					1964. This listing is the highest level of historic status available from the United States Secretary of the
					Interior. These sites are so special that they are eligible for consideration to become national parks. With
					the town's colorful Victorian-era homes, clapboard storefronts, boutiques, art galleries, gourmet
					restaurants, historic buildings and more, Telluride is a delight to explore. Our citizens are committed to
					preserving Telluride's historically significant architecture, open space, traditional design elements and, 
					most of all, Telluride’s small-town mountain lifestyle.</div>

					<div class="main2-right-middle"><img src="../image/4.jpg"/></div><br/><br/>
					<div class="main2-right-bottom">Mountain Village is perched above the valley floor at 9,500 feet, providing 
					access to the Telluride Ski Resort and Uncompahgre National Forest. The Town of Mountain Village was founded 
					in 1987 and includes approximately 2,100 acres of rolling aspen and spruce-covered mountainsides. A vision of
					 alpine elegance, this European-style village tempts guests with the best of everything in the Telluride region.
					  Coming into its own as a leading community, Mountain Village embraces green practices and sustainable growth in
					   its everyday operations.<br/>
					   The two towns are connected by a free, scenic gondola—the only transportation system of its kind in North 
					   America. The 13-minute ride is a daily event for residents and visitors alike. Exploring both Telluride 
					   and Mountain Village is easy with the convenience of the gondola.</div>

					The towns of Telluride and Mountain Village are linked by a spectacular, 13-minute ride on a free gondola—the first and only free public transportation system of its kind in the United States. This popular scenic attraction provides access to hiking and biking trails in the summer and the ski slopes in the winter. Passengers can load the gondola in either Mountain Village or Telluride and ride to the midway point (Station St. Sophia from which hiking, biking and ski trails are accessed) and then continue on to the other side.<br/><br/>
Once you discover this unique mountain mode of travel, you'll find a front row seat to view Mother Nature from 10,500 feet. The ride from Telluride to Station San Sophia has an elevation change of 1,750 feet; the ride from Station San Sophia to Mountain Village has a 960-foot conversion. The gondola runs daily from 6:30 a.m. to midnight during summer and winter. On select event dates, extended hours may be in place. The gondola closes for a short duration in the late spring and fall for maintenance and other operational needs.<br/><br/>
The gondola has three primary stations where you can board and unload:<br/><br/>
<ul><li>Station Telluride (Oak Street) – access in Telluride</li>
<li>Station St. Sophia (mid-mountain stop) – access to Allred’s Restaurant & Bar, The Ridge Club and ski resort trails and runs</li>
<li>Station Mountain Village – access in Mountain Village</li>
<li>Just across from Station Mountain Village, a shorter gondola stretch connects to Station Village Parking, where the free parking garage, Town Hall and the Mountain Market are located.</li></ul>
Handicap-accessible cabins are available, as well as pet cabins for well-behaved animals on leashes. Please ask a gondola attendant for help boarding; they can slow down the cabins for those with strollers, wheel chairs, etc.<br/>
In the winter, ski and snowboard racks are mounted on the exterior of cabins, and gondola attendants help load equipment.  In the summer, bike racks are mounted on the exterior of the cabins, and gondola attendants help load bikes.<br/><br/>
